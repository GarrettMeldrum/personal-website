## **The Route Overview**
<br></br>

This was my second class 3 route and I was really enjoyed this route. I arrived to the Bierstadt trail head around 4:10am and was on the trail by 4:15am. The hike up to Bierstadt was quite enjoyable but also bland. I quickly hurried to the summit so that I could be on the Sawtooth by sunrise. 
<br></br>

<br></br>

This view was right below the summit of Mount Bierstadt but I thought it was a good view of the mountain. I did the last push and to be honest, I only spent 5-10 minutes at the peak. I went ahead and prepared for the traverse and began moving towards the traverse.
<br></br>

This was my first class 3 down climb and the moves were really enjoyable. Most of this consisted of moving from boulder to boulder and route finding. To my suprise, this route was marked very well. 
<br></br>

## **Approaching the Sawtooth traverse**
<br></br>

<br></br>

Very quickly, I recieved my first proper view of the traverse and realized I had it all to myself. Although the traverse looks wicked, the moves are very comfortable and exposure was pretty minimal.
<br></br>

## **The Spire**
<br></br>

<br></br>

After quite a bit of class 3 moves, you reach this really cool spire that serves as a marker to move off of the ridge direct route. At this point, there are still markers, but it is important to go right around the spire. The moves here are harder and more exposed.
<br></br>

## **After the spire and towards the shoot**
<br></br>

<br></br>

Once you make your way around the spire, you are going to cross to the other side of the ridge and begin your final class 3 section. After walking over a well marked, but exposed trail, you get a good view of the shoot.
<br></br>

<br></br>

This shoot is certianly the most exposed portion of the route, although the moves are quite solid and kept me confident. This portion is steep as well, I had to stop mutliple times to catch my breathe. 
<br></br>

## **The hike towards Mount Blue Sky**
<br></br>

<br></br>

The hike to Mount Blue Sky was so much longer than I anticipated. Also, this peak in the photo above is a false summit, not Mount Blue Sky. I could not believe the huge field that was up here connecting the exit of the Sawtooth, Mount Spaulding, and Mount Blue Sky. 
<br></br>

The couple of miles towards the summit have you following the side of the ridge that consisted of boulder hopping and other hard class 2 terrain. Truthfully, from here on out, the route was pretty brutal. 
<br></br>
