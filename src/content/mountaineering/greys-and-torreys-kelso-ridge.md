<h2><b>The Kelso Ridge Route</b></h2>

<br></br>

The Kelso Ridge was my first class three route. I had intentially went with the Kelso Ridge because several forums say it is one of the easiest class three routes up a fourteener. I had reviewed several route reviews to get a good understanding of what I would be up against. I had read a report from the week prior of the route saying it was roughly 80-90% summer conditions. With that information, I set the date and left early in the morning to ensure I would get a parking spot at the upper trailhead.
<br></br>

Exiting I-70, you're immedietaly greated with the lowertrail head and the offroad drive up to the uppertrail head. This road is pretty terrible, several parts that bottom out completely and is notorious for puncturing fuel tanks on vehicles. I would highly recommend having a 4WD vehicle or something with great clearance. Eagerly, I arrived at the uppertrail head around 4:15am, I was followed by a convoy of other vehicles looking to get a good spot and an early start. There were several individuals car camping in the uppertrail head which I am sure I gave them an unwanted early wake up with my 400 lumen headlamp.
<br></br>

I geared up and started on the standard route around 4:30am. The first bit of the standard route sends you through a valley that eventually gets you to the base of Grays and Torreys. There will be a very clear fork in the standard route, this divergance marks the start of the Kelso Ridge route. 
<br></br>

<h2><b>Arriving to the saddle and beginning the ridge</b></h2>

<br></br>

<br></br>

Upon reaching the saddle, the route is going to be class 2 and 3 from here on out. I took a break to helmet up and strap up my trekking poles and was on my way. The first part of the ridge is well marked with a pretty visible trail that you will follow until pretty much reaching the white rock, which is about halfway up the ridge. To my suprise, I didn't see anyone above me or below me, I was going to have the whole ridge to myself!
<br></br>

I was pretty stoked to be up there, so I was moving quickly as the terrain to begin was a lot of class 2 with occasional class 3 moves. Because it was early season, the snow patches dictated my approach and I ended up staying mostly ridge direct to avoid dealing with too much exposed snow patches.
<br></br>

<br></br>

About halfway up the ridge, the route becomes a lot more technical to the summit. At this point, I spent more time planning my route up each section of the ridge. As I mentioned previously, I wanted to stay ridge direct, this ended up making the route slightly more difficult at times. I was thinking it would serve as good training to try to stay direct as much as possible. 
<br></br>

Taking your time and making strong secure moves is important at this point, this section of the route is slow going and requires you to be strategic. The next section of the route is going to be the knifes edge, the crux of the route. 
<br></br>

<h2><b>Approaching the knifes edge</b></h2>

<br></br>

Famously, the knifes edge on Kelso Ridge offers a good deal of exposure and an introduction to knife edges on ridgelines. This was my first time taking one of these on and it was all smiles as I approach the crux, I was so excited. Because of the time of year, the snow lessened the exposure and even made it possible to take it from the snow patch if you prefered. 
<br></br>

I ended up taking a break in the middle for some fruit snacks and enjoyed the exposure. To say I was having a blast would be an understatement.
<br></br>

<h2><b>Reaching the finishing couliour</b></h2>

<br></br>

Once you are off the knifes edge, there is the final approach to the summit. In summer conditions, there is a marked trail up to the summit. When I was there, the approach was completely covered in snow. I was not necessarily prepared for this type of approach, but I made the best of it and it ended up being okay. I put on microspikes and pulled out the trekking poles for more stability climbing up. Slowly, the approach was behind me and I had made it to the top of Torreys Peak!
<br></br>

<h2><b>Top of Torreys Peak</b></h2>

Torreys Peak stands at 14,272ft at the time of writing this and I had made it to the top and silently celebrated my first class 3 route!
<br></br>

<h2><b>Walking over to Greys Peak</b></h2>

![Image of mountain goats]( /images/mountaineering/greys-and-torreys-kelso-ridge/mountain-goat.jpg )
<br></br>

From here on out, I took the standard route over to Greys Peak and eventually off the mountain. This was also the first point I had ran into any other people! 
<br></br>

## **Ascending Greys Peak**
<br></br>

At this point in the hike, I was beginning to feel it and was ready to get Greys bagged and head down the mountain. Especially because of the amont of people that were on the standard route on this day.
<br></br>

I reached the top of Greys Peak which stands at 14,275ft at the time of writing this and spent significantly less time on this summit compared to Torreys. The amount of 14ers you can see from the top of these two peaks is incredible. I used the app PeakVisor to identify them all around me and was blown away. 
<br></br>

## **Descending the standard route**
<br></br>

About half way down Greys Peak I began to feel the exhaustion immensly. There is nothing difficult about the decsent on the standard route that is difficult, I was just tired from the two peaks. Eventually, I made it back down to the normal hiking trail and trekked back to the trailhead. Once I made it back to my car, I fired up the jetboil and ate an MRE and enjoyed the view!
<br></br>

<h2><b>Thoughts and Conclusion</h2></b>
<br></br>

The kelso ridge is absolulety worth anyones time looking to get into mountaineering or more difficult 14ers. There are so many resources online to keep you on route and give you enough confidence to take this on. I had watched and read Virtual Sherpa's guide and read the route description provided by 14ers.com. Highly recommend this route to anyone looking for a challenge!
