## **View of the kelso ridge from the standard route up Greys**

<br></br>

This was my first class three hike and I intentially chose the Kelso Ridge as it is often called the "easiest class 3 14er" in the state. So, this sounded like a perfect start to my 2025 mountaineering season.
I checked on 14ers.com to see if anyone else had done the route this early in the season and luckily there was a trail report a week before I had went stating the route is 80-90% summer conditions.
<br></br>

I left my house at 3:00AM to get to the trailhead. After exiting I-70, you are immediately greated with a pretty rough offroad trail that lasts about ~3.5 miles. I would recommend a 4WD vehicle or at minimum, large clearance vehicle.
I arrived to the trailhead and was one of the first up that morning followed by a convoy of other hikers that flowed in after me. There were several car campers at the trailhead as well. 
<br></br>

![Gear for the hike]( /images/mountaineering/greys-and-torreys-kelso-ridge/gear.jpg )
<br></br>

I geared up and started on the trail at around 4:30AM on the standard route. After a few miles, I made it to the fork that sends you on your way to the Kelso Ridge.
Once you reach the saddle of the ridge, you are greeted with an abandoned mine on your right. Once you are on the saddle, it will be a class 2 or higher hike.
<br></br>

<br></br>

## **On the Saddle and onward**
<br></br>
The ridge ascent is a little over 1 mile long and for the first half, it was largely class 2 moves with occasional class 3 action. I was feeling really good and making excellent time on this part. 
Because it was early season, snow patches blocked a lot of the easier off ridge part of the routes. So I was forced to take the ridge direct appraoch on most moves, this led me to taking on some class 4 moves that otherwise, would not have been necessary. 
<br></br>

## **reaching the white rock**
<br></br>
Once I reached the white rocks, the route became much more technical to the summit. Keeping ridge direct from here on out, I had some awesome exposure and took more time to complete this section.
I was able to make my way through this section and began to approach the crux of the route
<br></br> 

## **Reaching the knifes edge**
<br></br>
Famously, Kelso Ridge features an awesome and exposed knifes edge. This was my first knifes edge and I was all smiles as I took in the crux then eventually slowly manuveuring my way across. 
I spent more time on this section becuase of how great the exposure and moves felt on this part. I was having a blast!
<br></br> 

## **Reaching the final couliour**
<br></br>
Once you are off the knifes edge, there is the final approach to the summit. In summer conditions, there is a marked trail up to the summit. When I was there, the approach was completely covered in snow. 
I was not necessarily prepared for this type of approach, but I made the best of it and it ended up being okay. I put on microspikes and pulled out the trekking poles for more stability climbing up. 
Slowly, the approach was behind me and I had made it to the top of Torreys Peak!
<br></br>

## **Top of Torreys Peak**
<br></br>
Torreys Peak stands at 14,272ft at the time of writing this and I had made it to the top and silently celebrated my first class 3 route!
<br></br>

## **Walking over to Greys Peak**
<br></br>
From here on out, I took the standard route over to Greys Peak and eventually off the mountain. This was also the first point I had ran into any other people!

## **Ascending Greys Peak**
<br></br>
At this point in the hike, I was beginning to feel it and was ready to get Greys bagged and head down the mountain. Especially because of the amont of people that were on the standard route on this day.
I reached the top of Greys Peak which stands at 14,275ft at the time of writing this and spent significantly less time on this summit compared to Torreys. The amount of 14ers you can see from the top of these two peaks is incredible. I used the app PeakVisor to identify them all around me and was blown away. 
<br></br>

## **Descending the standard route**
<br></br>
About half way down Greys Peak I began to feel the exhaustion immensly. There is nothing difficult about the decsent on the standard route that is difficult, I was just tired from the two peaks. Eventually, I made it back down to the normal hiking trail and trekked back to the trailhead. Once I made it back to my car, I fired up the jetboil and ate an MRE and enjoyed the view!
<br></br>

## **Thoughts and Conclusion**
<br></br>
The kelso ridge is absolulety worth anyones time looking to get into mountaineering or more difficult 14ers. There are so many resources online to keep you on route and give you enough confidence to take this on. I had watched and read Virtual Sherpa's guide and read the route description provided by 14ers.com. Highly recommend this route to anyone looking for a challenge!
