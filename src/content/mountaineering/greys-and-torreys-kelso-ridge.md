This was my first class three hike and I intentially chose the Kelso Ridge as it is often called the "easiest class 3 14er" or "best beginner class 3 14er". So, this sounded like a perfect start to my 2025 mountaineering season.
I checked on 14ers.com to see if anyone else had done the route this early in the season and luckily there was a trail report a week before I had went stating the route is 80-90% summer conditions.

I left my house at 3:00AM to get to the trailhead. After exiting I-70, you are immediately greated with a pretty rough offroad trail that lasts about ~3.5 miles. I would recommend a 4WD vehicle or at minimum, large clearance vehicle.
I arrived to the trailhead and was one of the first up that morning followed by a convoy of other hikers that flowed in after me. There were several car campers at the trailhead as well. 

<br></br>

I geared up and started on the trail at around 4:30AM on the standard route. After a few miles, I made it to the fork that sends you on your way to the Kelso Ridge.
Once you reach the saddle of the ridge, you are greeted with an abandoned mine on your right then immediately into class 2 hiking here until the summit of Torreys peak.

<br></br>

Right as you start the ridge ascent, you are met with pretty wicked exposure in several areas. I was really enjoying my morning on the ridge and after getting into the traverse, I had reached class 3 moves that required me to start reading the route more carefully.
Eventually, I reached more snow covered terrain that was essentially all class 3/4 moves up until the summit. I have to add, the part snow part rock sections were so fun to traverse and highly recommend early season ascents.
