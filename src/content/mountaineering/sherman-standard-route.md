<h2><b>Route Overview</b></h2>

<br></br>

Mount Sherman from the standard route is 5.25 miles and 2,100ft of elevation. The standard route is entirely class 1 with some sections with reasonable exposure compared to other class 1 routes. This mountain is considered one of the easiest 14ers in Colorado, for that reason, it is recommended to show up very early or camp overnight. One of the cooler aspects of the route is all of the mining sites and equipment scattered along the way. Out of all of the close to Denver 14ers, Mount Sherman had the best standard route and in my opinion is the best beginner 14er.

For this trip, I was accomplied by two good friends and my wonderful girlfriend. For two individuals in our team, this was there first 14er! We arrived at the trailhead a little after 7:00am on a weekend. We had no trouble finding parking at the upper trailhead, even with several parties already ahead of us. We geared up and got on the trail!

<h2><b>Switch Backs and getting to the saddle</b></h2>

<br></br>

The first part of this route follows a gravel road that will take on elevation very quickly. After passing a mining site on your left, you begin the approach to the saddle of the ridgeline. The gravel road disapates and a trail picks up that you will follow until the summit. Eventually, you will approach some switchbacks that will take you the final way up to the saddle.

<h2><b>The ridgeline approach</b></h2>

<br></br>

Once on the saddle, the western slope trail, from Leadville, meets the standard trail on top of the saddle. The rest of the route from here consists of loose rock and ridge exposure. There are several steep parts on loose terrain that can be difficult to new mountaineers. After a little bit on this steep, uphill terrain, you will be thrown out onto the ridgeline for the final bit of the route which includes the crux.

<h2><b>Riding the ridgeline and summiting Mount Sherman</b></h2>

<br></br>

The ridgeline will take you to a false summit initially, then you walk over to the real summit. The ridge was the best part for me, gaining some exposure and more technical terrain for the final stint made the route exciting. The summit, of course, was filled with people. It wasn't hard to find a spot to ourselves where we hung out and refueled before heading down.

<h2><b>Descent</b></h2>

<br></br>

We had spent a decent amount of time on the summit taking in the view on a blue bird day. Of course, all I cared about was pointing out all the surrounding 14ers in the area. The decent was consistent and easily done by all party members. There are several sections of the decent that are loose rock/dirt that could be challenging for some.

<h2><b>Conclusion and thoughts </b></h2>
Mount Sherman is a perfect beginner 14er. The trail was extremely visible and many groups. The road was iffy at points but is a gravel road with little clearance needed besides right at the summer trailhead. I recommend this to anyone looking for a first 14er regardless of fitness level.
