<h2><b>Route Overview</b></h2>
<br></br>

Mount Sherman from the standard route is 5.25 miles and 2,100ft of elevation. The standard route is entirely class 1 with some sections with reasonable exposure compared to other class 1 routes. This mountain is considered one of the easiest 14ers in Colorado, for that reason, it is recommended to show up very early or camp overnight. One of the cooler aspects of the route is all of the mining sites and equipment scattered along the way. Out of all the close and easy 14ers, Mount Sherman was definetely my favorite!

<h2><b>Arriving and gearing up</b></h2>

For this trip, I was accomplied by two good friends and my wonderful girlfriend. For two individuals in our team, this was there first 14er! We arrived at the trailhead a little after 7:00am on a weekend. We had no trouble finding parking at the upper trailhead, even with several parties already ahead of us. We geared up and got on the trail!

<h2><b>Switch Backs and getting to the saddle</b></h2>
<br></br>

The first part of this route follows a gravel road that will take on elevation very quickly. After passing a mining site on your left, you begin the approach to the saddle of the ridgeline. The gravel road disapates and a trail picks up that you will follow until the summit. Eventually, you will approach some switchbacks that will take you the final way up to the saddle.

<h2><b>The ridgeline approach</b></h2>
<br></br>

Once on the saddle, the western slope trail, from Leadville, meets the standard trail on top of the saddle. The rest of the route from here consists of loose rock and ridge exposure. There are several steep parts on loose terrain that can be difficult to new mountaineers. After a little bit on this steep, uphill terrain, you will be thrown out onto the ridgeline for the final bit of the route which includes the crux.
