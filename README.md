Self-hosting my personal website / portfolio was a great opportunity for me to explore self-hosting, networking, and React/Next.js. You can visit my website at GarrettMeldrum.com

# Tech-stack and Design
This project utilizes the following stack of tech
- Linux (server)
- Cloudflare Tunnels (networking)
- Cloudflare ZeroTrust (auth)
- React/Next.js (framework)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript (languages)
- APIs (data fetching)
- Git (version control)

The server is ran on a linux machine that is hosting the website, cloudflare tunnel, and an API for some of my data. I went with a React framework and wanted the bells and whistles that Next.js added in. Of course, the internet is built on the holy trinity -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the additional fun that is TypeScript :).
